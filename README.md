### Contribute with Pull Requests
If you want to contribute with code, you're welcome! Please follow the next guidelines:

- Create an Issue, if it doesn't already exist, and express your desire of contributing in the development, that way we can organize ourselves and avoid to work in the same feature or bug.
- Use [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) Messages. This is used for the changelog and version generation.
- For the moment the project doesn't have any test, so please be sure of test that the plugin is still working before push.
- To test the plugin behavior the gradle task runIde can be used, this task regenerates the parser files, build the plugin and run the plugin in the IDE. (see the [JetBrains Documentation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/gradle-prerequisites.html#executing-the-plugin) for more details)
- If want to test the plugin in a specific IDE or version you can change in the `Intellij` block of the [build gradle file](build.gradle.kts). _See the [Gradle Intellij Plugin documentation](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin/) for more details._
